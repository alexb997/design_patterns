# Singleton Logger Example

This is a simple Java project demonstrating the Singleton pattern by implementing a `Logger` class.

## Project Structure

- `src/Logger.java`: Contains the `Logger` class implementing the Singleton pattern.
- `src/Main.java`: Contains the `Main` class which demonstrates how to use the `Logger` class.

## How to Run

1. **Compile the Java files:**

   ```bash
   javac src/Logger.java src/Main.java

   ```

2. **Run the main class:**
   ```bash
   java -cp src Main
   ```

You should see the log messages printed to the console, and a confirmation that both logger instances are the same.

## How to Set Up the Project

1. **Create the Project Directory:**

   ```bash
   mkdir SingletonLoggerExample
   cd SingletonLoggerExample

   ```

2. **Create the src Directory:**

   ```bash
   mkdir src

   ```

3. **Create java files:**

   *Create Logger.java and Main.java files in the src directory with the provided code.
   *Create a README.md file in the root directory with the provided content.

4. **Compile & run:**

   ```bash
   javac src/Logger.java src/Main.java
   java -cp src Main
   ```

This structure keeps the project simple and organized. You can expand it with additional classes and packages as needed.
